* Dom4j removed in favor of JAXP

The DOM manipulation style is a bit less clean, but this implementation
is included in the JVM, and we have removed an external dependency.

* Added the MigationProvider system to manage the migrations of beans.

This new system allows user to better isolate the competences among objects.
The MigationProvider gives the possibility to implement the migration methods
OUTSIDE the bean class, that remain clean.
